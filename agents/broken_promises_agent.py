#
# PURPOSE:
#   Detects outcome switching — when a clinical trial changes what it
#   promised to measure AFTER the study has already begun.
#
# WHY OUTCOME SWITCHING MATTERS:
#   Before a trial starts, sponsors must register exactly what they
#   plan to measure as the primary outcome.
#   Example: "Reduction in HbA1c at 26 weeks"
#
#   If the drug fails to show results on that measure, some sponsors
#   quietly change the primary outcome to something the drug DID work for.
#   This is called "outcome switching" — it is scientific fraud.
#   The published paper then reports success on the NEW outcome
#   while hiding that the original outcome was a failure.
#
#   This agent finds these cases by comparing what was originally
#   registered against what was actually measured and reported.

    YOUR MISSION:
    Detect outcome switching — cases where a clinical trial changed its
    primary outcome measure AFTER the study began enrolling participants.

    This is one of the most serious research integrity violations because
    it allows sponsors to hide negative results by measuring something
    different from what they originally promised.

    YOUR REASONING RULES:
    {procedures_text}

    YOUR WORKFLOW:
    1. Search past episodes for similar outcome switching cases
    2. Search for studies with protocol amendments
    3. For suspicious studies, fetch full amendment history with get_study_amendments
    4. Compare the registered primary outcome against what was actually measured
    5. Check the timing — did the change happen AFTER enrollment began?
    6. Generate signals for confirmed cases with appropriate confidence

    CONFIDENCE SCORING:
    - 0.9+ : Primary outcome changed after >50% enrollment, no scientific justification
    - 0.8  : Primary outcome changed mid-study, weak justification
    - 0.7  : Secondary outcome changed to primary after enrollment
    - 0.6  : Measurement method changed (not the outcome itself)
    - Below 0.6: Ambiguous — send to human review

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    {{
    "nct_id": "NCT_ID",
    "signal_type": "broken_promise",
    "summary": "What changed, when it changed, why it matters",
