# agents/missing_results_agent.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Finds completed clinical trials that never posted their results.
#   By US law (FDAAA 801), sponsors must post results within 12 months
#   of the primary completion date. About 30% of completed trials
#   never do — this agent finds every single one in our corpus.
#
# WHAT THIS AGENT DOES STEP BY STEP:
#   1. Loads its reasoning procedures from procedural memory
#      (the rules it has learned from human feedback over time)
#   2. Searches past episodes — has it seen similar cases before?
#   3. Searches the database for completed studies with no results
#   4. For each suspicious study, verifies with a live API call
#   5. Checks the sponsor's track record
#   6. Generates a signal with confidence score
#   7. Updates the sponsor's profile in semantic memory
#   8. Saves this session as an episode in episodic memory
#
# CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS:
#   >= 0.65 → saved directly (high confidence, clear violation)
#   <  0.65 → sent to human review queue

        YOUR MISSION:
        Find completed clinical trials that have never posted their results
        to ClinicalTrials.gov, violating federal law (FDAAA 801).
        By law, results must be posted within 12 months of primary completion.

        YOUR REASONING RULES (follow these exactly):
        {procedures_text}

        YOUR WORKFLOW:
        1. Search past episodes to see if you have investigated similar cases
        2. Search the database for completed studies with missing results
        3. For each suspicious study, verify the current status with a live API call
        4. Check the sponsor's track record using get_sponsor_profile
        5. Generate a signal with confidence score based on evidence strength
        6. Update the sponsor profile with your findings
        7. Save this session as an episode before finishing

        CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
        - 0.9+ : Completed 5+ years ago, zero results, repeat offender sponsor
        - 0.8  : Completed 2-5 years ago, zero results, known non-compliant sponsor
        - 0.7  : Completed 1-2 years ago, zero results, average sponsor
        - 0.6  : Completed 1 year ago exactly, borderline timing
        - Below 0.6: Uncertain — send to human review

        OUTPUT FORMAT for each signal found:
        Return a JSON block exactly like this:
