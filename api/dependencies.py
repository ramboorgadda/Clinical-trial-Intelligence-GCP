# api/dependencies.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Creates and manages shared resources that API endpoints need.
#
# WHAT IS A FASTAPI DEPENDENCY?
#   A dependency is a function that FastAPI calls AUTOMATICALLY before
#   running an endpoint. The endpoint receives the dependency's return
#   value as a parameter.
#
#   Example:
#     @app.get("/signals")
#     async def get_signals(store: VectorStore = Depends(get_vector_store)):
#         ...
#
#   FastAPI sees "Depends(get_vector_store)", calls get_vector_store(),
#   and passes the result as the "store" parameter automatically.
#   The endpoint never creates the store itself — it just uses it.
#
# WHY USE @lru_cache?
#   lru_cache = Least Recently Used Cache.
#   It makes a function return the SAME object every time it is called
#   instead of creating a new one each time.
#
#   Without lru_cache:
#     get_hitl_gate() creates a new HITLGate() on every API request.
#     Every request opens a new database connection pool. Very wasteful.
#
#   With lru_cache:
#     get_hitl_gate() creates ONE HITLGate() on the first call.
#     Every subsequent call returns that same object.
#     One connection pool shared across all requests. Efficient.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No. api/main.py and routers import from this file.
