# ingestion/pubmed_client.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file talks to PubMed — a free database run by the US government
#   that stores millions of published medical research papers.
#   It finds and downloads research papers that reference specific
#   clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov.
#
# WHY WE NEED THIS:
#   ClinicalTrials.gov tells us what a study PROMISED to measure.
#   PubMed tells us what researchers ACTUALLY PUBLISHED about it.
#   The gap between those two things is where signals live.
#   Example: A trial files "no serious side effects observed"
#            but three published papers discuss concerning safety events.
#            That gap is a signal worth flagging.
#
# HOW PUBMED SEARCH WORKS — TWO STEPS:
#   PubMed does not let you search and get full details in one call.
#   It requires two separate API calls:
#
#   Step 1 — esearch:
#     Send a search query → get back a list of paper IDs
#     Example: search for "NCT04788680" → get back ["38234567", "37891234"]
#
#   Step 2 — efetch:
#     Send those paper IDs → get back full paper details
#     Example: send ["38234567", "37891234"] → get title, abstract, authors
#
#   This two-step design is how PubMed's eUtils API works.
#   We cannot skip step 1 and jump straight to step 2.
#
# RATE LIMITING — IMPORTANT:
#   PubMed allows 3 requests per second without an API key.
#   If we send requests faster than that, they get blocked.
#   We add a 400ms sleep between requests to stay safely under the limit.
#   400ms = 2.5 requests per second — safely below the 3/second limit.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No — same as clinical_trials_client.py, this is a client class.
#   It gets imported and used by run_ingestion.py.
#   Do not run it directly.
#
# HOW OTHER FILES USE THIS:
#   from ingestion.pubmed_client import PubMedClient
#
#   async with PubMedClient() as client:
#       papers = await client.fetch_papers_for_trial("NCT04788680")
