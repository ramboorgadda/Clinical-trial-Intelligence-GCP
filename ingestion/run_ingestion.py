# ingestion/run_ingestion.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This is the file students actually RUN. Everything we built so far —
#   clinical_trials_client.py, pubmed_client.py, document_parser.py,
#   gcs_store.py — was just preparation. None of those files did
#   anything by themselves. This file is where it all comes together
#   and real data actually starts flowing.
#
# THINK OF THIS FILE LIKE A KITCHEN:
#   clinical_trials_client.py = the person who goes shopping for ingredients
#   pubmed_client.py          = the person who goes shopping at a different store
#   document_parser.py        = the person who washes and chops everything
#   gcs_store.py               = the person who puts everything in the fridge
#   run_ingestion.py           = YOU, the head chef, who tells everyone
#                                 what to do and in what order
#
# WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY DOES, STEP BY STEP:
#   1. Pick a list of medical conditions to search for
#      (example: "diabetes", "cancer", "heart disease")
#   2. For each condition, ask ClinicalTrials.gov for matching studies
#   3. Save the RAW version of every study to Google Cloud Storage
#   4. Clean up each study using document_parser.py
#   5. Save the CLEANED version to Google Cloud Storage too
#   6. For each study, ask PubMed if any research papers mention it
#   7. Save those papers (raw and cleaned) the same way
#   8. Print a final summary of everything that happened
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   YES. This is the one file in the ingestion folder you actually run.
#   Run it from your terminal like this:
#
#     python3 ingestion/run_ingestion.py
#
# WHAT OUTPUT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU RUN IT:
#   You will see a stream of log lines in your terminal showing:
#   - Which condition is currently being searched
#   - How many studies were found
#   - Each study being saved (raw, then cleaned)
#   - PubMed papers being searched for each study
#   - A final summary at the bottom with total counts
#
#   A full run with a handful of conditions usually takes a few
#   minutes — most of the time is spent waiting on the PubMed API,
#   since we deliberately slow down requests to respect their
#   rate limit (see RATE_LIMIT_SLEEP in pubmed_client.py).

# ENTRY POINT
#
# This is the part of the file that actually RUNS when you type:
#   python3 ingestion/run_ingestion.py
#
# Everything above this point just DEFINES functions and classes —
# none of it executes until Python reaches this final block.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This is a standard Python pattern.
    # __name__ is automatically set to "__main__" ONLY when this
    # file is run directly (python3 run_ingestion.py).
    # If this file is ever IMPORTED by another file instead of run
    # directly, __name__ would be "ingestion.run_ingestion" instead,
    # and this block would be skipped — preventing the pipeline
    # from accidentally running just because something imported it.

    asyncio.run(run_ingestion())
    # asyncio.run() is what actually KICKS OFF our async pipeline.
    # Everything we built — every "async def" function, every
    # "await" keyword — has been waiting for this single line.
    # This is the ignition key that starts the whole engine.
