# memory/episodic_store.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file gives MOSAIC the ability to REMEMBER what it found
#   in past analysis sessions — and search through those memories
#   by meaning, not just by keyword.
#
# WHAT IS EPISODIC MEMORY — THE SIMPLE VERSION:
#   Think of a detective who keeps a case notebook.
#   Every time they investigate a case, they write down what they
#   found, who was involved, and what conclusions they drew.
#   Next time a similar case comes up, they flip through the notebook
#   and ask "have I seen something like this before?"
#
#   That is exactly what episodic memory does for our agents.
#   Every time an agent runs and finds a signal, that session
#   gets saved as an "episode" — a record of what was investigated,
#   what was found, and what the agent concluded.
#
# WHAT IS AN EPISODE EXACTLY?
#   One episode = one agent reasoning session.
#   Example episode:
#     agent_name : "missing_results_agent"
#     nct_id     : "NCT04788680"
#     content    : "Investigated Novo Nordisk trial. Completed May 2019.
#                   Results never posted. 1200 participants enrolled."
#     outcome    : "signal_generated"
#
#   This gets saved with a vector embedding of the content so that
#   future searches can find it by MEANING — not just keyword match.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR:
#   99% of agent tutorials build agents that start fresh every time.
#   No memory. No learning. No continuity. Amnesia on every run.
#
#   MOSAIC is different. Every agent run BUILDS on previous runs.
#   Before investigating, the agent asks: "what do I already know?"
#   It searches its past episodes and uses that context.
#   The system gets smarter every time it runs.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No. This defines a class used by the agents.
#   Agents import and use EpisodicStore automatically.

# THE EpisodicStore CLASS
#
# A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
# EpisodicStore is a blueprint for an object that knows how to:
#   - Connect to our Cloud SQL database
#   - Save agent reasoning sessions as episodes
#   - Search through past episodes by meaning
#   - Return recent episodes for the API
#
# We create ONE instance of this class and reuse it throughout
# the application rather than creating a new instance for every call.
# This is efficient because the database connection pool is expensive
# to create — we want to create it once and reuse it many times.
##############################################################################
class EpisodicStore:
    """
    Stores and retrieves agent reasoning sessions as episodes.

    Each episode is one agent's reasoning session — what it
    investigated, what it found, and what it concluded.
    Episodes are embedded and stored so future sessions can
    search through past findings by meaning.

    Usage:
        store = EpisodicStore()

        # Save what an agent found
        await store.save_episode(
            agent_name="missing_results_agent",
            nct_id="NCT04788680",
            content="Novo Nordisk trial completed 2019. Results never posted.",
            outcome="signal_generated"
        )

        # Search past episodes by meaning
        past = await store.search_episodes(
            query="sponsor never posted results",
            agent_name="missing_results_agent",
            top_k=3
        )

        # It just makes sure the pool exists — no value comes back.
        """
        Makes sure the database connection pool is open.

        WHAT IS LAZY INITIALISATION?
        Instead of opening the database connection the moment
        EpisodicStore() is created, we wait until someone actually
        tries to use it. This is called "lazy initialisation."

        WHY DO WE DO THIS?
        When MOSAIC starts up, it imports many classes including
        EpisodicStore. If we opened the database connection in
        __init__, every import would immediately try to connect
        to Cloud SQL — even if that class is never actually used
        in that run. Lazy initialisation avoids wasted connections.

        This method is called at the START of every public method
        (save_episode, search_episodes, etc.) to guarantee the
        pool is open before we try to use it.

    # WHAT IS A STATIC METHOD?
    #
    # A @staticmethod is a method that belongs to the CLASS
    # but does NOT have access to the instance (self) or the
    # class itself (cls).
    #
    # Normal method:   def my_method(self, ...)

    #
    # WHY USE STATIC HERE?
    # _init_connection does not need to access ANY instance
    # variables — it only works with the "conn" parameter passed
    # to it by asyncpg. Using @staticmethod makes this explicit
    # and prevents accidental use of self inside the method.

        # we never call _init_connection ourselves.
        """
        Registers the custom pgvector VECTOR codec on a connection.

        WHAT IS A CODEC?
        A codec is a pair of functions:
        ENCODER: converts Python data → database format
        DECODER: converts database format → Python data

        WHY DO WE NEED A CUSTOM CODEC FOR VECTOR?
        PostgreSQL knows about the VECTOR type (added by pgvector).
        But asyncpg is a generic driver — it only knows about
        standard PostgreSQL types like TEXT, INTEGER, FLOAT etc.
        It has NO idea what to do with VECTOR.

        Without registering this codec:
        - Writing: asyncpg cannot convert our Python list of
            floats into the format pgvector expects → error
        - Reading: asyncpg cannot convert the VECTOR value it
            gets back from the database into a Python list → error

        With this codec registered:
        - Writing: [0.023, -0.041, 0.891] → "[0.023,-0.041,0.891]"
        - Reading: "[0.023,-0.041,0.891]" → [0.023, -0.041, 0.891]

        asyncpg calls this function automatically on every new
        connection it creates, via the init= parameter above.

        Args:
            conn: One fresh database connection from the pool.
                asyncpg passes this automatically.

        Converts any text string into a 1536-number vector embedding.

        WHAT IS AN EMBEDDING — ONE MORE TIME SIMPLY:
        An embedding is a position on a giant meaning map.
        Similar texts end up close together on that map.
        "Results never posted" and "outcomes not published" would
        be very close together even though the words are different.

        We use this method in TWO places:
        1. When SAVING an episode — embed the content so it can
        be found by semantic search later.
        2. When SEARCHING episodes — embed the query so we can
        compare it against stored episode embeddings.

        Using the SAME model for both is critical — embeddings
        from different models cannot be compared meaningfully.

        Args:
            text: Any text string to convert to an embedding.
