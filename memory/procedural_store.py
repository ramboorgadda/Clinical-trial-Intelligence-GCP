# memory/procedural_store.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file gives MOSAIC agents the ability to learn HOW to reason
#   better over time — based on feedback from human reviewers.
#
# WHAT IS PROCEDURAL MEMORY — THE SIMPLE VERSION:
#   Think of a junior doctor who just started working.
#   On day 1, they follow a basic checklist when diagnosing patients.
#   Over time, senior doctors correct them:
#     "When a patient has BOTH symptom A and symptom B together,
#      always check for condition X first — not condition Y."
#   The junior doctor writes this correction into their personal
#   rulebook. Next time they see that combination, they follow
#   the updated rule automatically.
#
#   That is exactly what procedural memory does for our agents.
#   Each agent starts with a set of DEFAULT reasoning rules.
#   When a human reviewer REJECTS a signal and explains why,
#   that rejection reason gets written into the agent's rulebook
#   as a new rule — permanently changing how it reasons.
#
# EPISODIC vs PROCEDURAL — WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
#   Episodic memory  = WHAT happened in past sessions
#                      "I found missing results for NCT04788680"
#                      Like a diary — records of past events.
#
#   Procedural memory = HOW to reason — the rules themselves
#                       "When a trial was terminated early,
#                        missing results are expected — not a violation"
#                       Like a rulebook — guidelines for behaviour.
#
# THE LEARNING LOOP — THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT:
#   1. Agent generates a signal → "NCT04788680 has missing results"
#   2. Human reviewer looks at it
#   3. Human REJECTS it with reason:
#      "This trial was terminated early due to COVID —
#       missing results for terminated trials are expected"
#   4. That reason gets written into the agent's procedures table
#      as a new rule: "Check if trial was TERMINATED before flagging
#      missing results — terminated trials are exempt"
#   5. Next time the agent runs, it LOADS its procedures first
#   6. It applies the new rule and correctly skips terminated trials
#
#   ONE human correction → agent reasons differently FOREVER after.
#   This is the learning loop that makes MOSAIC smarter over time.
#
# WHERE PROCEDURES ARE STORED:
#   In Cloud SQL, in the "procedures" table.
#   This table needs to be created — SQL is provided below.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No. Agents import and use ProceduralStore automatically.

# BEFORE USING THIS FILE — CREATE THE PROCEDURES TABLE
#
# Connect to Cloud SQL and run this SQL:
#
# CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS procedures (
#     procedure_id   UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
#     agent_name     TEXT NOT NULL,
#     rule_text      TEXT NOT NULL,
#     rule_type      TEXT DEFAULT 'learned',
#     source         TEXT DEFAULT 'default',
#     created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
#     updated_at     TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
# );
#
# WHAT EACH COLUMN MEANS:
#   procedure_id  → unique ID for this rule
#   agent_name    → which agent owns this rule
#   rule_text     → the actual reasoning rule in plain English
#   rule_type     → "default" (built-in) or "learned" (from HITL)
#   source        → "default" (initial) or "hitl_rejection" (from human)
#   created_at    → when this rule was first created
#   updated_at    → when this rule was last modified

# DEFAULT RULES — EVERY AGENT STARTS WITH THESE
#
# These are the built-in reasoning rules that every agent loads
# at the very start of every session — BEFORE doing any analysis.
# Think of these as the agent's "training manual" that it received
# on day 1. They encode the baseline knowledge of what to look for
# and what edge cases to handle.
#
# When a human rejects a signal and explains why, a NEW rule is
# added to the database alongside these defaults. On the next run,
# the agent loads BOTH the defaults AND any learned rules.
