#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file manages the SPONSOR KNOWLEDGE BASE — a growing collection
#   of facts about every research sponsor MOSAIC has ever encountered.
#
# WHAT IS SEMANTIC MEMORY — THE SIMPLE VERSION:
#   Think of a credit rating agency like CIBIL in India or
#   Experian in the US. Every time you take a loan or miss a payment,
#   your credit score changes. The agency builds up a profile of your
#   financial behaviour over years of transactions.
#
#   That is exactly what semantic memory does for sponsors.
#   Every time MOSAIC analyses a study, it updates the sponsor's profile:
#     - Did they post results on time? → credibility goes UP
#     - Did they miss results? → credibility goes DOWN
#     - Did they switch outcomes? → broken promises count goes UP
#     - Did they delay the trial silently? → average delay goes UP
#
#   Over time, MOSAIC builds a rich, data-driven picture of every
#   sponsor's behaviour — not based on reputation, but on EVIDENCE.
#
# EPISODIC vs PROCEDURAL vs SEMANTIC — THE FULL PICTURE:
#   Episodic   = WHAT happened in past sessions (case diary)
#                "I found missing results for NCT04788680 on March 15"
#
#   Procedural = HOW to reason — the rules (rulebook)
#                "Do not flag terminated trials as missing results"
#
#   Semantic   = FACTS about the world — accumulated knowledge (encyclopedia)
#                "Novo Nordisk: 47 studies, credibility 0.82, 2 broken promises"
#
# WHERE SPONSOR PROFILES ARE STORED:
#   In the existing "sponsor_profiles" table in Cloud SQL.
#   This table was created as part of our original schema —
#   no new table creation needed for this file.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No. Agents import and use SemanticStore automatically.
#   The Track Record agent uses it most heavily.
#
# HOW AGENTS USE THIS:
#   from memory.semantic_store import SemanticStore
#
#   store = SemanticStore()
#   profile = await store.get_sponsor_profile("Novo Nordisk")
#   await store.update_sponsor_knowledge(
#       sponsor="Novo Nordisk",
#       results_posted=True,
#       had_broken_promise=False,
#       delay_days=12

    Manages the sponsor knowledge base — credibility profiles
    built up over time as MOSAIC analyses more studies.

    Each sponsor gets ONE profile row in the sponsor_profiles table.
    That row is updated (never replaced) every time new information
    about that sponsor is discovered during an analysis run.

    Think of it as a living document about each sponsor —
    it grows richer with every analysis, never starts from scratch.

    Usage:
        store = SemanticStore()

        # Get what we know about a sponsor
        profile = await store.get_sponsor_profile("Novo Nordisk")

        # Update after analysing a study

        WHAT IS RETURNED:
        A dictionary containing the sponsor's full profile:

        Updates a sponsor's profile with new information from one study.

        USES THE UPSERT PATTERN:
        "UPSERT" = INSERT if the sponsor does not exist,
                   UPDATE if they already do.
        PostgreSQL does this in one statement using:
        INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE

        This is more efficient and safer than checking first with
        SELECT, then deciding whether to INSERT or UPDATE.
        The two-step approach has a "race condition" — two agents
        running in parallel could both check, both see "not exists",
        and both try to INSERT, causing a duplicate key error.
        UPSERT handles this atomically — it is thread-safe.

        HOW THE CREDIBILITY SCORE IS RECALCULATED:
        After updating the counts, we recalculate credibility:
          compliance_rate = results_posted_count / total_studies
          promise_penalty = broken_promises * 0.1
