# PURPOSE:
#   This file defines tools that let agents fetch LIVE research papers
#   directly from PubMed during an analysis run.
#
# WHY DO WE NEED PUBMED TOOLS SEPARATELY FROM search_tools.py?
#   search_tools.py searches papers that are ALREADY in our database —
#   papers we downloaded during ingestion and stored as chunks.
#
#   pubmed_tools.py fetches papers LIVE from PubMed on demand.
#
#   The difference matters for the Side Effect Checker agent:
#   It needs to find papers published AFTER our ingestion run.
#   A paper published last week about a safety concern would not
#   be in our database — but PubMed has it right now.
#
# WHICH AGENTS USE THESE TOOLS?
#   Side Effect Checker   → fetch_papers_for_trial (primary user)
#                           Compares official filings vs published papers
#   Pattern Finder        → search_pubmed_by_query
#                           Finds papers that discuss multiple trials
#   Missing Results Agent → fetch_papers_for_trial
#                           Checks if results were published in papers
#                           even though they were not posted officially
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ON RATE LIMITS:
#   PubMed allows 3 requests per second without an API key.
#   Our PubMedClient already handles rate limiting with a 400ms sleep.
#   These tools respect that — do not call PubMed tools in rapid loops.

    Fetch all published research papers that reference a specific

    Official filings are written by the sponsor.
    Published papers are written by independent researchers.

@tool
def compare_filing_vs_papers(
    nct_id: str,
    filing_summary: str,
) -> str:
    """
    Fetch papers for a trial and compare them against the official filing.

    This is the Side Effect Checker's most powerful tool.
    It fetches all published papers about a trial, then returns
    both the official filing summary AND the papers — so the agent
    can compare them and identify discrepancies.

    The agent looks for:
    - Safety events mentioned in papers but not in the filing
    - Different severity levels (filing says "mild", paper says "serious")
    - Outcomes reported in papers that differ from the primary outcome
    - Results published in papers when no official results were posted

    Args:
        nct_id:          The trial's NCT ID.
        filing_summary:  A summary of what the official filing says.
                         The agent provides this from earlier tool calls.
                         Example: "Filing reports no serious adverse events.
                                   Primary outcome was HbA1c reduction.
                                   Results posted: No."

    Returns:
        JSON string with:
        - filing_summary: what the agent passed in (echoed back)
        - papers: all published papers found on PubMed
        - comparison_note: guidance on what to look for
        - papers_count: how many papers were found
